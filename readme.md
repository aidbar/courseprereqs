# Course Prerequisite Chain App

An application that draws course prerequisite chains from Sisu course unit data ([sisu_courseunit.json file] (https://opendata.tuni.fi/tau-curriculum-data/)). 

Created as an assignment for the HTI.550 Information Analytics and Visualisation course at Tampere University in 2023. 

List of technologies used:
* D3.js for graph visualization.
* Node.js for backend
* Express.js for APIs
* Handlebars for front-end

The application is partially based on [this tutorial by Eze Sunday] (https://blog.logrocket.com/data-visualization-d3-js-node-js/).
